# myanimerecomendation
I used 6,000 anime data collected by crawling 120 pages from the MyAnimeList website using async I/O and batching techniques. The crawled data was then processed using regex to extract anime links. These links were then used to fetch data via the MyAnimeList API.  

After obtaining the complete dataset, the 6,000 anime entries were processed using text processing techniques such as text cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization, and text vectorization. Their similarity was then measured using two similarity algorithms: Jaccard and Cosine.  

To identify hidden gem anime, I applied a threshold to filter anime with a minimum rating as a standard for high-quality anime and a minimum popularity level to identify lesser-known anime.

ðŸš¨ Deployment Issue Notice:
The deployment of the project on Streamlit is currently unavailable due to exceeding the Git LFS (Large File Storage) bandwidth quota. The error message indicates that the repository has surpassed its data transfer limit, preventing the retrieval of large files such as anime_list.pkl. This results in failed updates and prevents the app from running properly.

To resolve this, users are advised to deploy the application locally by cloning the repository and running it on their own machine. If you encounter issues related to missing data files, ensure that the required datasets are available or regenerated before running the app.
